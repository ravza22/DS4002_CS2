## Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook document outlining the case study is the file labeled [CS2Hook_Gerrymandering.pdf](/CS2Hook_Gerrymandering.pdf). The rubric [CS2Rubric_Gerrymandering.pdf](/CS2Rubric_Gerrymandering.pdf) outlines the formatting, submission requirements, and final deliverables for this assignment. Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.

## Data
The image data can be obtained from FiveThirtyEight linked [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/). The Data folder contains several images for various states, but there are more states to choose from on FiveThirtyEight. Additionally, you can find the declination angle (i.e., the numeric representation of the degree of partisan gerrymandering in a state) [here](https://observablehq.com/@sahilchinoy/gerrymandering-the-declination-function), which you will use to verify the results of your image analysis.
